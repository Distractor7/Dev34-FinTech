# üìä Financial Reports System Documentation

## üéØ Overview

The Financial Reports system provides real-time financial analytics for property management, displaying key performance indicators (KPIs), property-level breakdowns, and trend analysis. This document explains how the system currently works and provides a roadmap for making it production-ready.

## üîç Current System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Firebase Invoices Collection ‚Üí Date Range Filter ‚Üí Aggregation ‚Üí Display
```

### Core Components

- **FinancialService**: Main service handling all financial calculations
- **Invoice Data**: Primary source of financial information
- **Property Mapping**: Links invoices to properties for breakdowns
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh when date ranges change

---

## üìä How Financial Stats Are Calculated

### 1. Revenue Card üí∞

**Source**: Invoice collection
**Calculation**:

```typescript
const totalRevenue = invoices.reduce((sum, invoice) => sum + invoice.total, 0);
```

**What it shows**: Total invoice amounts within selected date range

### 2. Expenses Card üí∏

**Source**: **NOT from invoices** - Currently hardcoded
**Calculation**:

```typescript
const expenses = totalRevenue * 0.3; // 30% assumption
```

**Current limitation**: Uses estimated 30% of revenue as placeholder

### 3. Profit Card üìà

**Source**: Calculated from revenue and expenses
**Calculation**:

```typescript
const profit = totalRevenue - expenses;
const marginPct = (profit / totalRevenue) * 100;
```

**What it shows**: Estimated profit based on assumed expenses

### 4. Invoices Card üìã

**Source**: Invoice status field
**Calculation**:

```typescript
const paidInvoices = invoices.filter((invoice) => invoice.status === "paid");
const invoicesPaidPct = (paidInvoices.length / invoices.length) * 100;
```

**What it shows**: Payment completion rate and percentage

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current Data Structure

### Invoice Schema (What We Have)

```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string; // Links to properties
  status: "draft" | "sent" | "paid" | "overdue" | "cancelled";
  issueDate: string; // Date filtering
  subtotal: number; // Pre-tax amount
  tax: number; // Tax amount
  total: number; // Final amount (subtotal + tax)
  lineItems: InvoiceLineItem[]; // Service breakdown
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Financial Summary (What We Calculate)

```typescript
interface FinancialSummary {
  revenue: number; // From invoice.total
  expenses: number; // Currently estimated (30% of revenue)
  profit: number; // revenue - expenses
  marginPct: number; // (profit / revenue) * 100
  invoicesPaidPct: number; // Payment completion rate
  totalInvoices: number; // Count of invoices
  paidInvoices: number; // Count of paid invoices
  overdueInvoices: number; // Count of overdue invoices
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations & Assumptions

### 1. **Expense Tracking is Fake**

- ‚ùå No real expense data
- ‚ùå Hardcoded 30% assumption
- ‚ùå No cost breakdown by service type

### 2. **Profit Margins are Estimates**

- ‚ùå Based on assumed expenses
- ‚ùå Not reflective of actual business performance
- ‚ùå No industry benchmarking

### 3. **Limited Financial Insights**

- ‚ùå No cost vs. revenue analysis
- ‚ùå No profitability by service type
- ‚ùå No overhead allocation

---

## üöÄ Roadmap: Making It Production-Ready

### Phase 1: Real Expense Tracking üéØ

#### 1.1 Create Expenses Collection

```typescript
interface Expense {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string;
  providerId: string;
  category: "labor" | "materials" | "overhead" | "utilities" | "maintenance";
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  invoiceId?: string; // Link to related invoice
  approvedBy: string;
  status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";
  receipts: string[]; // File URLs
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### 1.2 Update Financial Calculations

```typescript
// Real expense calculation
const realExpenses = expenses.reduce((sum, expense) => sum + expense.amount, 0);

// Real profit calculation
const realProfit = totalRevenue - realExpenses;
const realMargin = (realProfit / totalRevenue) * 100;
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Financial Analytics üìä

#### 2.1 Service Type Profitability

```typescript
interface ServiceTypeAnalysis {
  serviceType: string;
  revenue: number;
  expenses: number;
  profit: number;
  marginPct: number;
  invoiceCount: number;
  avgInvoiceValue: number;
}
```

#### 2.2 Property Performance Metrics

```typescript
interface PropertyPerformance {
  propertyId: string;
  propertyName: string;
  revenue: number;
  expenses: number;
  profit: number;
  marginPct: number;
  roi: number; // Return on investment
  occupancyRate: number; // If applicable
  maintenanceCosts: number;
  utilityCosts: number;
}
```

### Phase 3: Cost Allocation & Budgeting üí°

#### 3.1 Budget vs. Actual Tracking

```typescript
interface Budget {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string;
  year: number;
  month: number;
  category: string;
  budgetedAmount: number;
  actualAmount: number;
  variance: number;
  variancePct: number;
}
```

#### 3.2 Overhead Allocation

```typescript
interface OverheadAllocation {
  propertyId: string;
  overheadType: "admin" | "marketing" | "insurance" | "property_tax";
  allocatedAmount: number;
  allocationMethod: "square_footage" | "revenue" | "equal";
  period: string;
}
```
